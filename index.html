                              <h3>AWS Technologies</h3>
                              <h4>Core (EC2, VPC, S3, IAM, SNS, SES, SQS, CloudWatch, Config, CloudTrail, CloudFormation, Route53)</h4>
                              <p>I have done extensive work in AWS. I have built a number of systems that leveraged most of the core services.</p>
                              <h4>Lambda</h4>
                              <p>I have created a number of lambdas in node.js, Python, and Java. Most have been larger lambdas that were written in Java. I am very comfortable testing these applications and managing an event-driven architecture.</p>
                              <h4>Kinesis Firehose, Elasticsearch Service, Athena</h4>
                              <p>I created a forensic logging solution for Ancestry using these technologies. I am very comfortable with the APIs and the workflow.</p>
                              <h4>RDS, DynamoDB</h4>
                              <p>Most of my applications have not required databases but were instead event-based. I have written a couple of web-services for Ancestry that required databases and used both RDS and DynamoDB in these.</p>
                              <h3>C languages</h3>
                              <h4>Java</h4>
                              <p>Ancestry currently does development in Java and my earlier college courses used Java extensively. I use IntelliJ as my default editor for Java so I am most comfortable with its environment.</p>
                              <h4>C#</h4>
                              <p>Ancestry used to use C# in almost all of its development. I have done quite a number of programs including WinForms, WPF, and ASP.NET. I am very familiar with Visual Studio.</p>
                              <h3>Scripting Languages</h3>
                              <h4>Node.js</h4>
                              <p>I have created multiple websites using Node.js including some larger websites that were used as backends. Node.js is a really fun scripting language and have enjoyed writing small scripts for school and personal projects.</p>
                              <h4>Python</h4>
                              <p>I have taken multiple classes in school that were done primarily in Python. I am quite comfortable in this language and have done extensive scripting.</p>
                              <h3>Database</h3>
                              <h4>MySQL</h4>
                              <p>Ancestry switched from SQL Server to MySQL and I was able to learn about some of the differences between the two and how to interface with and use MySQL.</p>
                              <h4>SQLite</h4>
                              <p>I have used SQLite for quite a few personal projects. We also use SQLite at Ancestry as a way to send information back and forth between our vendors. We also built a recipe based system for managing operations performed on a collection of images.</p>
                              <h3>Process Management</h3>
                              <h4>Kanban</h4>
                              <p>I use Kanban for my personal projects and the team projects I have done in school.</p>
                              <h4>Scrum</h4>
                              <p>I have participated in many scrum teams and am very familiar with this methodology.</p>
                              <h3>Other</h3>
                              <h4>Git</h4>
                              <p>I use Git for all of my version control. I use it every day for both work projects and my private repositories.</p>
                              <h4>OpenStack Swift</h4>
                              <p>I created a file copying and management system that interfaces with an OpenStack Swift cluster. The system essentially allowed users to use the Swift cluster as if it were a file system.</p>

                              I thoroughly enjoy reading. I read whenever I can and can often be seen with a book. I grew up with a mother who was nearly obsessed with books which meant we had thousands of books in bookshelves littered throughout our house for us kids to enjoy. My favorite genres are fantasy and science fiction. I also enjoy classics like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Count-Monte-Cristo-Penguin-Classics/dp/0140449264">The Count of Monte Cristo</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Tale-Cities-Dover-Thrift-Editions/dp/0486406512">A Tale of Two Cities</a> but I will read just about any good book. Some of my favorites include:

                              I grew up surrounded by music. My siblings and I played at least two instruments growing up. My parents required us all to play the piano and urged us to pick up at least one more instrument. My extra instruments became the guitar, the trumpet and I also participated in choir. I enjoy playing soft piano and acoustic guitar music. I also enjoy listening to music throughout each day.  Lately it has been <a href="http://www.enya.com/">Enya</a>, <a href="http://timeline.coldplay.com/">Coldplay</a>, <a href="http://thepianoguys.com/">The Piano Guys</a>, and occasionally some dubstep.

                              As I mentioned earlier, I really like to eat. I am not at all a picky eater and will try just about anything. Britney and I love the <a href="http://locations.thecheesecakefactory.com/ut/Salt%20Lake%20City-157.html/">Cheesecake Factory</a> and will sometimes make the one hour drive up to Salt Lake City just to go there. We have also been known to go to Park City to eat at the <a href="http://www.theeatingestablishment.net/">Eating Establishment</a>. We like to find good food wherever we go. Some local places we like to go include:

                              I grew up playing every sport I could. These included, Basketball, Football, Baseball, Soccer, Wrestling, Swimming, Gymnastics, and Racquetball. Almost all of those phased out except Soccer, Basketball and Racquetball. I played soccer for my high school team and played recreation basketball throughout and after high school. I still look for opportunities to play any of those sports. 
                              <p></p>
                              Since graduating from college I have really gotten into running, cycling and now mountain biking. I love trail running in the mountains near Utah Valley. I also enjoy biking the Alpine Loop, South Fork and anywhere else that is challenging and scenic. I recently got into mountain biking and it has been a blast.
                              <p></p>
                              I am also a big BYU sports fan. I follow football and basketball primarily but will cheer on anyone wearing the BYU uniform (provided they aren't complete knuckleheads).

                              <h3 id="about-hobbies-games" class="about-header anchor">games</h3>
                              My brothers and I played a lot of video games together when we were young. We were often satisfied simply to watch one of the brothers play. We had many of the classic games on NES like <a href="http://nintendo.wikia.com/wiki/Duck_Hunt">Duck Hunt</a>, <a href="http://tecmobowl.org/playtecmo2014">Techmo Bowl</a> and <a href="http://punchout.wikia.com/wiki/Mike_Tyson">Mike Tyson Punch-Out</a>. We enjoyed a succession of consoles from Sega to N64 to PS2 to XBox360. We also played PC games like <a href="http://cyan.com/games/myst/">Myst</a>, <a href="http://us.blizzard.com/en-us/games/hots/landing/">Starcraft</a>, and <a href="http://us.blizzard.com/en-us/games/war3/">Warcraft</a> (though not World of Warcraft). We still sometimes get together to play games and prefer ones we can all play together. 
                              <p></p>
                              We also all enjoy board and card games. We try to get together regularly to play some kind of game. Some of our favorites include:

                              We aren't big-time travelers but nevertheless enjoy traveling. We enjoy going to California and visiting Disneyland, the beaches and other random places in the Greater Los Angeles and San Diego areas. St. George is a convenient getaway for us and like to visit <a href="https://www.tuacahn.org/Online/default.asp">Tuacahn</a>, eat some of the good food down there and visit Zion National Park. Utah has some breathtaking <a href="http://www.utah.com/nationalparks/">national</a> and state parks which we like to visit. We made a trip to Manhattan after I graduated as a graduation present to both of us which was a blast. We sometimes visit family in <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/Tourism-g30354-Alta_Wyoming-Vacations.html">Alta Wyoming</a> and we spend a week at <a href="http://www.idealbeachresort.com/">Bear Lake</a> every year.  We look forward to many opportunities in the future to travel.

                              My wife and I prioritize family at the top of our lists. I want to spend as much time as I can with family and help our children grow up to achieve their full potential. We want to build a beautiful modern home somewhere in Utah Valley and live there until retirement if not longer.

                              While my goals in life never were to get into writing code, I have learned that I absolutely love to create things on the computer. It is magic to me and the best part is that I understand it (most of the time). I want to continue to write code the rest of my life. Whether it be small utilities, smartphone apps, or websites, I want to continue to hone my abilities to create. 
                              <p></p>
                              <h3 id="about-aspirations-education" class="about-header anchor">education</h3>
                              I have toyed with the idea of getting a PH.D. in Computer Science. When I began my undergraduate education the first thing I wanted to do was to become a physician. Even though I no longer have those wishes I haven't quite given up the idea of being called a doctor and obtaining a PH.D. is one way I could do that. In all seriousness though I believe I would enjoy the learning and research involved in a Computer Science PH.D. program.
                              <p></p>
                              I also want to continue learning regardless of how formal it might be. I love general education and want to continue to learn new things every day.
                              <p></p>

                              I have had the privilege of being a volunteer teacher for several <a href="https://programming.reedcwilson.com">programming fundamentals</a> courses at my local library. I have had a great time teaching what I love.

                              I served a two-year <a href="http://www.mission.net/en/main_missionfaq.html">LDS mission</a> in Atlanta Georgia (<a href="http://missionhome.com/?missions=georgia-atlanta-north-mission">Georgia Atlanta North Mission</a>). I lived in Grayson, Lawrenceville, Sandy Plains, Athens and Washington during my two years there and had many opportunities to provide community service and to share my beliefs regarding <a href="https://lds.org/lang=eng">The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</a>. I continue to practice my faith and am always interested in ways I can help my community to be a stronger and more conducive place for families to raise children.
