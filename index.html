                              <h3>C languages</h3>
                              <h4>C</h4>
                              <p>My systems classes used C at times. I am less familiar with C as I am C++ but feel comfortable enough in C to be competent.</p>
                              <h4>C++</h4>
                              <p>My beginner classes as well as my systems classes were all done in C++. I am familiar with Makefiles, GCC and the object-oriented concepts as they are done in C++. I have no experience with the Boost library but am comfortable writing in C++.</p>
                              <h4>C#</h4>
                              <p>Ancestry used to use C# in almost all of its development. I am extremely familiar with Visual Studio and would say that C# is my most comfortable language.</p>
                              <h4>Java</h4>
                              <p>Ancestry currently does development in Java and my earlier classes used Java extensively. I use IntelliJ as my default editor for Java so I am most comfortable with its environment.</p>
                              <h3>Web Technologies</h3>
                              <h4>AngularJS</h4>
                              <p>I have written a number of websites using AngularJS. Most recently I used AngularJS in a SPA at Ancestry. I also wrote another site called <a href="https://github.com/reedcwilson/broadcasts">broadcasts</a> using AngularJS.</p>
                              <h4>CSS</h4>
                              <p>I am most comfortable using CSS frameworks like UIKit and Twitter Bootstrap. I can write regular CSS if needed but I use frameworks for my own work because of the ease-of-use and speed they provide. This site uses Twitter Bootstrap.</p>
                              <h4>HTML</h4>
                              <p>I am comfortable writing HTML and use it to describe my page and not simply lay out the content the way I wish.</p>
                              <h4>JavaScript</h4>
                              <p>I have used JavaScript extensively at Ancestry. In terms of DOM manipulation, I am most familiar with JQuery and AngularJS but have used plain JavaScript in some scenarios where dependencies were undesirable.</p>
                              <h3>Scripting Languages</h3>
                              <h4>Node.js</h4>
                              <p>This website uses a Node.js back-end web server which I wrote. I have also created multiple websites using Node.js. Node.js is a really fun scripting language and have enjoyed writing small scripts for school and personal projects.</p>
                              <h4>Python</h4>
                              <p>I have taken multiple classes in school that were done primarily in Python. I am quite comfortable in this language and have done extensive scripting.</p>
                              <h4>Ruby</h4>
                              <p>I have contributed to a Ruby open source project called <a href="https://github.com/reedcwilson/syrup">syrup</a> which is used as a service to extract bank information. I wrote a tool to censor strings which I use to edit books I read called <a href="https://github.com/reedcwilson/censor-libs">censor-libs</a>.</p>
                              <h3>Database</h3>
                              <h4>MongoDB</h4>
                              <p>I have used MongoDB for school assignments as well as some personal projects. I have done two (<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B61tSETKk1a6LWY0STZFVGs5RG8/view?usp=sharing">one</a>, and <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B61tSETKk1a6WVFCbDhfQ3A1S28/view?usp=sharing">two</a>) in-depth research assignments on MongoDB and how it compares to other databases.</p>
                              <h4>MySQL</h4>
                              <p>Ancestry switched from SQL Server to MySQL and I was able to learn about some of the differences between the two and how to interface with and use MySQL.</p>
                              <h4>SQLite</h4>
                              <p>I have used SQLite for quite a few personal projects. We also use SQLite at Ancestry as a way to send information back and forth between our vendors. We also built a recipe based system for managing operations performed on a collection of images.</p>
                              <h4>SQL Server</h4>
                              <p>I have used this at Ancestry. All of the legacy data up until 2014 was stored in Microsoft SQL Server instances.</p>
                              <h3>Process Management</h3>
                              <h4>Kanban</h4>
                              <p>I use Kanban for my personal projects and the team projects I have done in school.</p>
                              <h4>Scrum</h4>
                              <p>I participated in a Scrum team during my most recent time at Ancestry.</p>
                              <h3>Other</h3>
                              <h4>Git</h4>
                              <p>I use Git for all of my version control. I use it every day and manage my private repositories, which primarily consists of school assignments, on BitBucket and host all of my other projects on GitHub.</p>
                              <h4>OpenStack Swift</h4>
                              <p>I created a file copying and management system that interfaces with an OpenStack Swift cluster. The system essentially allowed users to use the Swift cluster as if it were a file system.</p>
                              <h4>WPF</h4>
                              <p>I have written quite a few applications using WPF. A couple of these have been very large scale applications and I would say that I am very proficient in writing WPF applications</p>

                              Britney Wilson of American Fork, Utah and I were married on November 19, 2011 in the <a href="http://www.ldschurchtemples.com/">Salt Lake City Temple</a>. I graduated from BYU in April of 2015 with my undergraduate degree in Computer Science. We currently live in Pleasant Grove near where we both grew up. Britney finished up her degree in Family Life at BYU and currently works at DoTerra. Britney and I enjoy hiking, watching movies, eating good food, spending time with family and traveling whenever occasion allows.

                              I thoroughly enjoy reading. I read whenever I can and can often be seen with a book. I grew up with a mother who was nearly obsessed with books which meant we had thousands of books in bookshelves littered throughout our house for us kids to enjoy. My favorite genres are fantasy and science fiction. I also enjoy classics like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Count-Monte-Cristo-Penguin-Classics/dp/0140449264">The Count of Monte Cristo</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Tale-Cities-Dover-Thrift-Editions/dp/0486406512">A Tale of Two Cities</a> but I will read just about any good book. Some of my favorites include:

                              I grew up surrounded by music. My siblings and I played at least two instruments growing up. My parents required us all to play the piano and urged us to pick up at least one more instrument. My extra instruments became the guitar, the trumpet and I also participated in choir. I enjoy playing soft piano and acoustic guitar music. I also enjoy listening to music throughout each day.  Lately it has been <a href="http://www.enya.com/">Enya</a>, <a href="http://timeline.coldplay.com/">Coldplay's new album</a>, <a href="http://thepianoguys.com/">The Piano Guys</a>, and occasionally some dubstep. Pandora through <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5713551/pianobar-is-a-flash-free-pandora-player-inside-your-terminal">Pianobar</a> makes all of this very convenient.

                              As I mentioned earlier, I really like to eat. I am not at all a picky eater and will try just about anything. Since marrying Britney, however, I have learned to enjoy eating at nice places. We especially love the <a href="http://locations.thecheesecakefactory.com/ut/Salt%20Lake%20City-157.html/">Cheesecake Factory</a> and will sometimes make the one hour drive up to Salt Lake City just to go there. We have also been known to go to Park City to eat at the <a href="http://www.theeatingestablishment.net/">Eating Establishment</a>. We like to find good food wherever we go. Some local places we like to go include:

                              I grew up playing every sport I could possibly be enrolled in. These included, Basketball, Football, Baseball, Soccer, Wrestling, Swimming, Gymnastics, and Racquetball. Almost all of those phased out except Soccer, Basketball and Racquetball. I played soccer for my high school team and played recreation basketball throughout and after high school. I still look for opportunities to play any of those sports. 
                              <p></p>
                              I am also a big BYU sports fan. I follow football and basketball primarily but will cheer on anyone wearing the BYU uniform (provided they aren't complete knuckleheads).

                              <h3 id="about-hobbies-games" class="about-header anchor">games</h3>
                              My brothers and I played a lot of video games together when we were young. We were often satisfied simply to watch one of the brothers play. We had many of the classic games on NES like <a href="http://nintendo.wikia.com/wiki/Duck_Hunt">Duck Hunt</a>, <a href="http://tecmobowl.org/playtecmo2014">Techmo Bowl</a> and <a href="http://punchout.wikia.com/wiki/Mike_Tyson">Mike Tyson Punch-Out</a>. We have enjoyed a succession of consoles from Sega to N64 to PS2 to XBox360. We also played PC games like <a href="http://cyan.com/games/myst/">Myst</a>, <a href="http://us.blizzard.com/en-us/games/hots/landing/">Starcraft</a>, and <a href="http://us.blizzard.com/en-us/games/war3/">Warcraft</a> (though not World of Warcraft).  We still sometimes get together to play games but prefer ones we can all play together. 
                              <p></p>
                              We also all enjoy board and card games. We try to get together regularly to play some kind of game. Some of our favorites include:

                              We aren't big-time travelers but nevertheless enjoy traveling. We enjoy going to California and visiting Disneyland, the beaches and other random places in the Greater Los Angeles and San Diego areas. St. George is a convenient getaway for us and like to visit <a href="https://www.tuacahn.org/Online/default.asp">Tuacahn</a>, eat some of the good food down there and visit Zion National Park. Utah has some breathtaking <a href="http://www.utah.com/nationalparks/">national</a> and state parks which we like to visit. We made a trip to Manhattan after I graduated as a graduation present to both of us which was a blast. We sometimes visit family in <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/Tourism-g30354-Alta_Wyoming-Vacations.html">Alta Wyoming</a> and we spend a week at <a href="http://www.idealbeachresort.com/">Bear Lake</a> every year.  We look forward to many opportunities in the future to travel.

                              My wife and I want kids. We are interested in raising a family and helping children reach their full potential. We want to build a beautiful modern home somewhere in Utah Valley and live there until retirement if not longer.

                              <h3 id="about-aspirations-occupation" class="about-header anchor">occupation</h3>
                              While my goals in life never were to get into writing code, I have learned that I absolutely love to create things on the computer. It is magic to me and the best part is that I understand it (most of the time). I want to continue to write code the rest of my life. Whether it be small utilities, app for a smart phone or websites, I want to continue to hone my abilities to create. 
                              <p></p>
                              In terms of an occupation, I don't know if I necessarily want to work as a rank and file developer for the duration of my career. I would like to get into management somewhere that has an influence on the future of a product I am or become passionate about. I am interested in start-ups because the developers there are more influential in the grand scheme of the product. I am getting business minor and am interested in an MBA because I want to be more involved than someone who is simply told what to code.
                              <p></p>
                              <h3 id="about-aspirations-education" class="about-header anchor">education</h3>
                              As previously mentioned, I am interested in getting an MBA degree. I have also toyed with the idea of getting a PH.D. in Computer Science. When I began my undergraduate education the first thing I wanted to do was to become a physician. Even though I no longer have those wishes I haven't quite given up the idea of being called a doctor and obtaining a PH.D. is one way I could do that.  In all seriousness though I believe I would enjoy the learning and research involved in a Computer Science PH.D. program.
                              <p></p>
                              I also want to continue learning regardless of how formal it might be. I love general education and want to continue to learn new things every day.
                              <p></p>

                              I had the privilege of teaching a free <a href="https://github.com/reedcwilson/programming-fundamentals">programming fundamentals</a> course at my local library. I had about 10 students between the ages of 13 and 18 and had a great time teaching what I love.

                              I served a two-year <a href="http://www.mission.net/en/main_missionfaq.html">LDS mission</a> in Atlanta Georgia (<a href="http://missionhome.com/?missions=georgia-atlanta-north-mission">Georgia Atlanta North Mission</a>). I lived in Grayson, Lawrenceville, Sandy Plains, Athens and Washington during my two years there and had many opportunities to provide community service and to share my beliefs regarding <a href="https://lds.org/lang=eng">The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</a>. I continue to practice my faith and am always interested in ways I can help my community to be a stronger and more conducive place for families to raise children.
